![FrameWork-1](https://github.com/joshem163/WISE-GNN/assets/133717791/89269231-6105-4529-bdb1-9cbc59695eb3)


# Overview

Wise-GNN is an innovative machine learning model for Graph representation learning that utilizes a  novel approach named "Wise Embeddings", effectively integrating local topological information and positional information in the doamin feature spaces,to improve the performance of existing GNN models. This repository contains the code for the Wise-GNN paper. 
# Requirements
Wise-GNN depends on the followings:
Pytorch, Pyflagser, networkx 3.1, sklearn 1.3.0, torch_geometric 2.4.0

   
The code is implemented in python 3.11.4.
